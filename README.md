# instagallery
This is a React Native module that I developed as a challenge. In this module I'm trying to clone Facebook's Gallery feature. There's more refactoring to be done as this is my first try. 

**Features**
 - An array of objects can be passed in ( title, description, image source )
 - If the images won't fit into screen, you'll be able to scroll through the gallery
 - You'll be able to start to swipe from the picked image
 
 **Nice to have in the future**
 - Mimic Facebook's entire design ( Avatar Picture,Layout,  Posted time, Comments, Reactions ) 
 - Be able to pass in all more data ( Author, Posted Time, Reactions ) 

**Demo**
